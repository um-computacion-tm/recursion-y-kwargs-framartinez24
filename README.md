 Use of *args and **kwargs
Most programmers new to Python have difficulty understanding the use of *args and **kwargs. What are they used for? First of all, you don't actually have to use the names args or kwargs, since it is a mere convention between programmers. However, what you do have to use is the single * or double ** asterisk. That is, you could write *variable and **variables
